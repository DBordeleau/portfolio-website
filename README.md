This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) app created to curate my portfolio projects and help me connect with recruiters for internship and co-op opportunities.

The website is a single page made up of react functional components. The website was styled using [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) and the UI elements are animated using [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/).

The project was deployed via [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) and can be accessed at [dillonbordeleau.dev](https://dillonbordeleau.dev)
